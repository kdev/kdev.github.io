            Via a management interface it is possible to add and edit calendars.
        </p><p>
            </p><div class="figure"><a name="id-1.8.3.2.3.1"></a><p class="title"><b>Abbildung 6.1. Calendar management overview</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="screenshot"><div><img src="screenshots/appointment-calendar/calendarmanage-overview.png" alt="Calendar management overview"></div></div></div></div><p><br class="figure-break">
        </p><p>
            If a new calendar needs to be created or edited, it's necessary to define a
calendar name, a color and the permission group the calendar belongs
to. This is needed for agents to access the calendar properly with the
related permissions.
        </p><p>
            </p><div class="figure"><a name="id-1.8.3.2.5.1"></a><p class="title"><b>Abbildung 6.2. Calendar edit screen</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="screenshot"><div><img src="screenshots/appointment-calendar/calendarmanage-calendaredit.png" alt="Calendar edit screen"></div></div></div></div><p><br class="figure-break">
        </p><p>
            The color can be selected with the built-in color picker, like in the
following screenshot. There are three ways to select a color with the color
picker. After clicking on the preselected color, a window opens with a set
of pre-defined colors ready to be used. If your preferred color is not
available, you can click on the <span class="emphasis"><em>More</em></span> button to open the
advanced mode.
        </p><p>
            </p><div class="figure"><a name="id-1.8.3.2.7.1"></a><p class="title"><b>Abbildung 6.3. Color picker in calendar edit screen</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="screenshot"><div><img src="screenshots/appointment-calendar/calendarmanage-calendaredit-colorpicker.png" alt="Color picker in calendar edit screen"></div></div></div></div><p><br class="figure-break">
        </p><p>
            Within that mode, you can either select a certain color by using the color
bar and the color field with your mouse or you're able to directly use a
hexadecimal code of a desired color. By clicking on the
<span class="emphasis"><em>Less</em></span> button, you can shrink the color picker back again
to the standard mode. Right after a click on the
<span class="emphasis"><em>Confirm</em></span> button, the new color is selected and visible
in the preview field. Even if you selected a certain color within the
advanced mode, the previous color will be selected again (and visible in the
preview field) if you click on the <span class="emphasis"><em>Cancel</em></span> button, but
this just works if you didn't confirmed your selection yet. If that's the
case (but you did not save the calendar yet), you may just reload your
screen and see you current color setting again.
        </p><p>
            For the selected permission group of your calendar, an agent who should have
access to, needs at least a read permission within the related
group. Enclosed is a list of permissions to access certain feature-levels
within the different calendars:
        </p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">RO</span></dt><dd><p>
                        The related agent can see the calendar and its appointments, but can't do
any changes.
                    </p></dd><dt><span class="term">MOVE_INTO</span></dt><dd><p>
                        The related agent can update existing appointments, but can't create new
ones or delete existing ones.
                    </p></dd><dt><span class="term">CREATE</span></dt><dd><p>
                        The related agent can create new appointments.
                    </p></dd><dt><span class="term">RW</span></dt><dd><p>
                        The related agent is able to delete appointments.
                    </p></dd></dl></div><p>
            The validity field indicates if a calendar is valid. Invalid calendars won't
show up in the different overviews, even if agents have access to it.
        </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id-1.8.3.3"></a>Exporting calendars and/or appointments</h3></div></div></div><p>
            Once different calendars are created, it is possible to export either the
complete calendar definition (including the calendar appointments) in the
well-known YAML format or just export the related appointments of a calendar
to ICS format.
        </p><p>
            To export a complete calendar structure to the YAML format, the calendar
list in the calendar management screen can be used. By clicking on the
related link within column <span class="emphasis"><em>Export</em></span>, a YAML structure
named <code class="filename">Export_Calendar_CalendarName.yml</code>, including the
calendar meta-data (calendar name, color, permission group, validity state)
can be downloaded. The structure also includes all calendar
appointments. This functionality can be used to simply backup a certain
calendar and/or transfer it to a foreign OTRS instance.
        </p><p>
            To export just the calendar appointments in ICS format, the link within
column <span class="emphasis"><em>Download</em></span> can be used. After clicking on the
related link, an ICS file named <code class="filename">CalendarName.ics</code> can be
downloaded, including all appointments of the related calendar. This file
can be used to backup just the appointments of a certain calendar and/or
transfer it to either an existing calendar on a foreign OTRS instance or any
other calendar tool, which supports the ICS standard, to display the
appointments.
        </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id-1.8.3.4"></a>Importing calendars and/or appointments</h3></div></div></div><p>
            As an equivalent to the export function, it is possible to either import a
complete calendar structure including related appointments in the YAML
format, or just a set of appointments to an already existing calendar in the
ICS format.
        </p><p>
            To import a complete calendar structure, the related <span class="emphasis"><em>Calendar
Import</em></span> widget on the left side of the calendar management screen
can be used. Within this widget, a YML file can be selected and uploaded to
import the calendar. The checkbox <span class="emphasis"><em>Overwrite existing
entities</em></span> indicates if a calendar with the same name as the
imported one should be overwritten. If a calendar with the same name exists,
but the checkbox is empty during the upload, a related error message will be
displayed.
        </p><p>
            To import a set of appointments to an already existing calendar, the
<span class="emphasis"><em>Import Appointments</em></span> button can be clicked to access the
appointment import screen.
        </p><p>
            </p><div class="figure"><a name="id-1.8.3.4.5.1"></a><p class="title"><b>Abbildung 6.4. Appointment import in calendar management overview</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="screenshot"><div><img src="screenshots/appointment-calendar/calendarmanage-appointmentimport.png" alt="Appointment import in calendar management overview"></div></div></div></div><p><br class="figure-break">
        </p><p>
            Here it's needed to select an ICS file to be used for the import. Right
after that, a calendar needs to be selected from the related list to import
the new appointments in.  The checkbox <span class="emphasis"><em>Update existing
appointments</em></span> indicates, if already existing appointments with the
same UniqueID shall be overwritten or not. Appointments with the same
UniqueID but already existing in the related calendar won't be omitted
during the import process. They will be inserted again and will be available
multiple times in case of doubt, if the option to overwrite appointments is
not enabled.
        </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id-1.8.3.5"></a>Kalenderübersicht</h3></div></div></div><p>
            If at least one calendar is created and accessible by a certain agent, new
or already existing appointments can be managed via a calendar overview and
an agenda overview.
        </p><p>
            Within the calendar overview, an agent is able to display, create, edit
and/or delete appointments of different calendars, depending on their
permission level to the related calendars, as described above.
        </p><p>
            </p><div class="figure"><a name="id-1.8.3.5.4.1"></a><p class="title"><b>Abbildung 6.5. Calendar overview screen</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="screenshot"><div><img src="screenshots/appointment-calendar/calendaroverview.png" alt="Calendar overview screen"></div></div></div></div><p><br class="figure-break">
        </p><p>
            As visible in the following screenshot, the calendar overview contains the
management tools for the calendars and appointments on the left side and the
calendar view on the right side. With the buttons in the
<span class="emphasis"><em>Actions</em></span> widget it's possible to either access the
calendar management directly or add a new appointment (if the agent has the
permission).
        </p><p>
            </p><div class="figure"><a name="id-1.8.3.5.6.1"></a><p class="title"><b>Abbildung 6.6. Sidebar in calendar overview screen</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="screenshot"><div><img src="screenshots/appointment-calendar/calendaroverview-sidebar.png" alt="Sidebar in calendar overview screen"></div></div></div></div><p><br class="figure-break">
        </p><p>
            The <span class="emphasis"><em>Calendars</em></span> widget contains all calendars accessible
by the agent. The checkboxes are used to enable or disable the view of
certain calendars, like it's the case in many foreign calendar tools.
        </p><p>
            Since all appointments of any active calendar for every agent will be
provided by the server (and not stored or cached on the client), it can
result in heavy load on the server if too many calendars are active at the
same time. Therefore a system configuration option
<code class="literal">AppointmentCalendar::CalendarLimitOverview</code> limits the
maximum number of active calendars per agent. If the limit is reached by an
agent, a related error message will be displayed, indicating there are too
many active calendars.
        </p><p>
            The URL column provides an external link to the calendar, which is used to
subscribe.  This functionality is described later in this document.
        </p><p>
            To have a good overview of available appointments within different calendars
and the related dates the appointments start or end, we provide different
view modes to be used by the agents.
        </p><p>
            </p><div class="figure"><a name="id-1.8.3.5.11.1"></a><p class="title"><b>Abbildung 6.7. View modes in calendar overview screen</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="screenshot"><div><img src="screenshots/appointment-calendar/calendaroverview-viewmodes.png" alt="View modes in calendar overview screen"></div></div></div></div><p><br class="figure-break">
        </p><p>
            They are separated in timeline modes and non-timeline modes with different
time ranges, to have the best view on different appointments for the related
situations. On most of the view modes, a red line indicates the current time
of the current day.
        </p><p>
            The information in the middle of the top-bar shows the current time range
the agent is in, for the current view. Within the timeline views, the
current calendar week will be displayed in light gray, when possible. Within
the non-timeline views, the current calendar week is displayed as a single
column on the left side, if possible.
        </p><p>
            Enclosed a screenshot of the non-timeline weekly view:
        </p><p>
            </p><div class="figure"><a name="id-1.8.3.5.15.1"></a><p class="title"><b>Abbildung 6.8.

        </p><p>
            and the non-timeline monthly view:
        </p><p>
            </p><div class="figure"><a name="id-1.8.3.5.17.1"></a><p class="title"><b>Abbildung 6.9.

        </p><p>
            On the upper right side, the agents can access the navigation controls.
        </p><p>
            </p><div class="figure"><a name="id-1.8.3.5.19.1"></a><p class="title"><b>Abbildung 6.10.

        </p><p>
            The left- and right-arrow buttons are used to navigate through the dates of
the current time range. The <span class="emphasis"><em>Today</em></span> button brings the
agent back to the current date to save time.
        </p><p>
            The <span class="emphasis"><em>Jump</em></span> button is used to access a certain date
directly without a need to go every date in between to access a certain date
(maybe one year earlier or later). A click on the button opens a date
picker, which highlights all dates which have already appointments stored. A
mouseover shows the number of appointments with to the current date. A click
on a date brings the agent to the related time range and displays all
appointments.
        </p><p>
             </p><div class="figure"><a name="id-1.8.3.5.22.1"></a><p class="title"><b>Abbildung 6.11.

        </p><p>
            On the right side of the main widget (on top of the navigation buttons) a
gear wheel appears on mouse over, which is used to access a visibility
filter:

        </p><p>
            Here you can choose, if you want to see all available appointments, or just
the ones that are directly assigned to you.
        </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id-1.8.3.6"></a>Agendaübersicht</h3></div></div></div><p>
            Within the agenda overview, an agent is able to display the appointments of
all available (accessible) calendars in a table-like overview. This overview
is designed to have a detailed list of upcoming appointments in a structured
table. Like in the calendar overview appointments can be created, edited or
deleted. This view supports a monthly, weekly and daily point of view on
available appointments.
        </p><p>
            </p><div class="figure"><a name="id-1.8.3.6.3.1"></a><p class="title"><b>Abbildung 6.13.

            Within the calendar overview, to add new appointments it's either possible
to click on the <span class="emphasis"><em>Add Appointment</em></span> button or click on the
overview widget. It's also possible to drag over a range of the widget to
setup a rough time span. Right after that, a modal dialog appears where the
data can be inserted:
        </p><p>
            </p><div class="figure"><a name="id-1.8.3.7.3.1"></a><p class="title"><b>Abbildung 6.14.

        </p><p>
            The only mandatory fields of the basic information are the appointment title
and the related calendar to assign the appointment to. The description and
location are optional fields. If the location contains a value, a related
link icon will show up next to the field which by default links to Google
map to get a better picture of the location. This link is configurable
through the system configuration option
<code class="literal">AgentAppointmentEdit::Location::Link</code>.
        </p><p>
            Within the <span class="emphasis"><em>Date/Time section</em></span>, the related start date
and end date needs to be selected.
        </p><p>
            The <span class="emphasis"><em>All-day</em></span> checkbox indicates that the appointment
takes place on the whole day. If it's activated, time of the start date and
the end date will be disabled and set to 00:00.
        </p><p>
            The <span class="emphasis"><em>Repeat</em></span> option is used to define appointment
recurrences and will be described separately, see section
<span class="emphasis"><em>Repeating appointments</em></span> below.
        </p><p>
            The <span class="emphasis"><em>Notification</em></span> option is used to define appointment
notifications and will be described separately, see section
<span class="emphasis"><em>Notifications</em></span> below.
        </p><p>
            The <span class="emphasis"><em>Link</em></span> option is used to define appointment links to
foreign objects (like tickets)  and will be described separately, see
section <span class="emphasis"><em>Link tickets to appointments</em></span> below.
        </p><p>
            If the appointment already exists, the <span class="emphasis"><em>Copy</em></span> and
<span class="emphasis"><em>Delete</em></span> buttons appear at the bottom of the modal
dialog, provided that the current agent has the related permissions. The
<span class="emphasis"><em>Copy</em></span> button will just ignore the changes in the dialog
and create a copy of the current appointment at the same time range with
same information. The <span class="emphasis"><em>Delete</em></span> button will delete related
appointment, but the agent will face a question if they are really sure they
want to delete the appointment, for security reasons.
        </p><p>
            Once the appointment has been saved, it appears in the overview of the page:
        </p><p>
            </p><div class="figure"><a name="id-1.8.3.7.12.1"></a><p class="title"><b>Abbildung 6.15.

        </p><p>
            With a click on the appointment, the modal dialog opens again and
appointment can be edited. If the agent has the correct permission, the
appointment can also be edited via drag and drop to either move the complete
appointment to another place (date/time) or just increase/decrease the
start- and/or the end-time by dragging the appointment on the related
handles on the left or the right end.
        </p><p>
            If the cursor of the mouse hovers over a certain appointment, a tooltip with
the related appointment information appears:
        </p><p>
            </p><div class="figure"><a name="id-1.8.3.7.15.1"></a><p class="title"><b>Abbildung 6.16.

            If appointments needs to be created in a recurring manner, it is possible to
setup detailed information about the occurrences of an appointment.
        </p><p>
            For this to work it is either possible to use pre-defined frequencies of the
occurrences, or to define custom settings:

            After the selection is finished, it's necessary to define the runtime of the
recurrences. It's possible to choose either a date to repeat until, or an
amount of times to repeat.
        </p><p>
            After all decisions are made and the settings are saved successfully, the
appointment will be marked a recurring appointment. The parent appointment
will be marked with circle-arrow-symbol and the child appointments with a
chain-symbol.

            Future changes to the parent appointment will affect the children
automatically, without any further message. If an agent is about to change
one of the child appointments, a message will ask what would they like to
update:
        </p><p>

        </p><p>
            If the update affects all appointments, the behavior will be the same as
with the update of the parent appointment. All options (including the
recurring settings) are changeable.
        </p><p>
            If just the current (child) occurrence is affected, it's not possible to
change the repeating settings, but a related message and a link to the

            Within the edit screen of an appointment, it is possible to setup a date to
notify about the appointment. As in the settings for appointment repeat, it
is possible to use pre-defined templates for notifications (i.e. 5 minutes
before, 15 minutes before etc.)  or to setup a custom point of time:
        </p><p>
            </p><div class="figure"><a name="id-1.8.3.9.3.1"></a><p class="title"><b>Abbildung 6.21.

        </p><p>
            The custom settings for notifications are split into a relative point of
time (like 5 minutes after the appointment has been started, 2 hours before
the appointment ends etc.) and an explicit date time value, which can
additionally be selected with a date picker. The related section needs to be
enabled with a radio button, hence the disabled section will be ignored.
        </p><p>
            If an appointment has an active notification setting, the date/time string
of the notification will be displayed in the tooltip. In addition to that,
the appointment will be marked with a bell-symbol to indicate that there is
an active notification set, without any mouse over actions.

            As in the well-known ticket notifications, this package comes up with an
event based notification mechanism, that can be handled using an
administration interface. Within that interface, notification event entries
can be created, updated and/or deleted to react on different OTRS events
with related filters, recipients and content templates.
        </p><p>
            During the installation of the package, one default entry
<span class="emphasis"><em>Appointment reminder notification</em></span> will be installed.
        </p><p>
            The management frontend for notification templates can be reached using the
administration menu:
        </p><p>
            </p><div class="figure"><a name="id-1.8.3.10.5.1"></a><p class="title"><b>Abbildung 6.22.

        </p><p>
            In the notification overview, all available notification templates can be
displayed.  Within that overview, such templates can be created, edited,
imported/exported and, of course, deleted.
        </p><p>

        </p><p>
            From the left sidebar, notification entries can either be created, exported
or imported.  The complete set of available entries can be exported, or an
already exported file can be used to import notification entries.
        </p><p>

        </p><p>
            The main table on the right side will display the available appointment
notifications.  For each line, the related entry can be edited by clicking
on the name column, exported with a click on the export icon, copied with a
click on the copy icon or even deleted.  All icons relates just to the
single entries (not like the export notifications button in the sidebar).

            In order to create a new or update an existing entry, edit screen can be
used, same as in the ticket notifications. Within that screen, it is needed
to define some basic parameters, like a name, which needs to be unique for
the OTRS system (it cannot even conflict with a name from the ticket
notifications).
        </p><p>
            Each notification entry can be made selectable as an option in the agent
preferences.  Optionally, a tooltip message for the related notification
entry in the user preferences can be inserted, which will be displayed to
the user on mouse over.
        </p><p>
            If needed, a comment for the entry can be added which will be displayed in
the overview screen of the administration interface. Last but not least, the
validity state can be selected (valid by default).
        </p><p>
            To let the template react on OTRS events, at least one of the available

            The appointment filter widget can optionally be used to narrow the list of
appointments by matching configured values:

            The appointment calendar comes with an abstraction layer to link external
objects with appointments, using the OTRS internal link object. Those
additional objects can come up with external packages without any further
need to update the code of the calendar directly.
        </p><p>
            Basically, within the edit screen of an appointment it is possible to link
existing tickets. Tickets can be searched by their ticket numbers and/or
ticket titles via an autocompletion field. Once the agent clicks on a
result, the related ticket will be saved in a result box and after the
appointment has been saved, the ticket will be linked to the appointment.
        </p><p>
            </p><div class="figure"><a name="id-1.8.3.11.4.1"></a><p class="title"><b>Abbildung 6.32.

        </p><p>
            Additionally, it's possible to link multiple tickets to one
appointment. Since the normal OTRS link object is used to create the
connection between both objects, the link will be displayed in the ticket
zoom screen as well.
        </p><p>
            </p><div class="figure"><a name="id-1.8.3.11.6.1"></a><p class="title"><b>Abbildung 6.33.

        </p><p>
            Those links can either be created through an existing appointment in the
related edit dialog, using the overviews or via the link feature in the
ticket zoom.

        </p><p>
            Via the ticket zoom screen, it's additionally possible to create a new
appointment, which links the related ticket automatically to the newly
created appointment. There is a new option <span class="emphasis"><em>New

<span class="emphasis"><em>Miscellaneous</em></span>.

        </p><p>
            After a click on the link, the agent will be forwarded to the calendar
overview, which automatically opens a new appointment dialog, that has the
related ticket pre-linked and can be filled out as usual.

            To make a step back to the calendar management, the package offers the
possibility to automatically create and update appointments in calendars,
using a special ticket search rule within the calendar edit screen.
        </p><p>
            Tickets can have special date/time entries like pending times, escalation
times (first response time, update time etc.) or assigned dynamic field from
type date/time.  Logically, the calendars are able to show those date/time
entries, but since the calendar appointments needs to have time ranges
consisting of a start time and an end time, it's needed to define a related
end time for managed appointments, as times like the pending time points to
just a single date/time value.
        </p><p>
            Below the basic calendar configuration in the calendar edit screen, a
special widget called <span class="emphasis"><em>Ticket Appointments</em></span> takes care
about the rules to be used for automatic appointment creation.
        </p><p>
            </p><div class="figure"><a name="id-1.8.3.12.5.1"></a><p class="title"><b>Abbildung 6.36.

        </p><p>
            It's necessary to define rules to describe a ticket search for tickets,
which will result in automatically created and managed appointments in the
related calendar. It's possible to define multiple rules with different
parameters to combine several types of tickets within the same calendar.
        </p><p>
            A rule consists of the following parameters to generate proper ticket
searches:
        </p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">Startzeitpunkt</span></dt><dd><p>
                        A dropdown list, that indicates the special date/time value of the related
tickets. This can be either the pending time, the different escalation times
or a dynamic field from type date/time assigned to the ticket.
                    </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Endzeitpunkt</span></dt><dd><p>
                        This can be a relative time value, counted from the selected start time
(like +5 minutes, +1 hour etc.) or a dynamic field from type date/time,
pointing to an absolute date and time value.
                    </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Queues</span></dt><dd><p>
                        A multi-selectable dropdown list, that indicates the queues the related
tickets needs to be located in. This field is mandatory and can't be left
unfilled.
                    </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Suchattribute</span></dt><dd><p>
                        This is a list of additional (optional) search attributes to provide more
detailed filter possibilities to the agent. It acts like the search
attributes in ticket search screen of the agent interface. Single attributes
can be selected, added to the form and filled out with filter values.
                    </p></dd></dl></div><p>
            An overview of the configuration for such a rule looks as follows:
        </p><p>
            </p><div class="figure"><a name="id-1.8.3.12.10.1"></a><p class="title"><b>Abbildung 6.37.

        </p><p>
            The rule in the screenshot will find all tickets that have a pending time
and would add one hour to the related pending time to generate the end time
and create appointments for the set of found tickets during the search. The
tickets additionally needs to be located in queue <span class="emphasis"><em>Raw</em></span>.
        </p><p>
            An example of an automatically added appointment looks as follows:

        </p><p>
            The <span class="emphasis"><em>P</em></span> symbol indicates that this appointment includes a
pending time as the start time value. The end time value is a dynamic field
from type date/time in this example to display a bigger appointment for that
test purpose.
        </p><p>
            Special appointments of different types will be marked with related symbols:

related ticket zoom screen.
        </p><p>
            Of course, it's still possible to define basic information like a
description and a location, which will be stored for that single
appointment. For such appointments it's also possible to define notification
times and link additional tickets.
        </p><p>
            Some of those start time values are variable and therefore updatable by the
related agent and some are not.
        </p><p>
            For instance the pending time is a value that can be changed using the
pending ticket action in the ticket zoom of the related ticket. Dynamic
field values can be changed easily, too.
        </p><p>
            An escalation value like first response time or the update time are special
values which will be computed using a Service / SLA entry assigned to the
related ticket.
        </p><p>
            If, for instance, an automatically created appointment of type pending time
is changed using the calendar overview, the related value will be updated in
the ticket as well, which is the same behavior as for special appointments
of type dynamic field. Therefore it's either possible to update the related
ticket using the ticket zoom, or by just updating the appointment that
writes back all needed changes to the ticket.
        </p><p>
            Appointments from type escalation time cannot be updated using the related
appointments, as those values are not changeable directly by the agent. Such
appointments are simply read-only on the related values, as well as on the
drag and drop features/handles.
        </p><p>
            On every update on the calendar definition or the related tickets, the
automatically created appointments will be updated as well. This work will
be done by the OTRS daemon in the background. Therefore, it's necessary to
have the daemon running for this feature to work properly!

            To have a quick overview about upcoming appointments, it's possible to
enable a dashboard widget called <span class="emphasis"><em>Appointments</em></span>.
        </p><p>
            </p><div class="figure"><a name="id-1.8.3.13.3.1"></a><p class="title"><b>Abbildung 6.40. Today filter in upcoming appointments dashboard widget</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="screenshot"><div><img src="screenshots/appointment-calendar/dashboardwidgettoday.png" alt="Today filter in upcoming appointments dashboard widget"></div></div></div></div><p><br class="figure-break">
        </p><p>
            This widget displays upcoming appointments of every accessible calendar by
the agent in a simplified manner.
        </p><p>
            It offers the possibility to create new appointments with a click on the
<span class="emphasis"><em>New Appointment</em></span> button, which forwards the agent to the
calendar overview screen and opens a new appointment dialog.
        </p><p>
            The widget content consists of three filter entries:
        </p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">Heute</span></dt><dd><p>
                        Displays upcoming appointments for the current date.
                    </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Morgen</span></dt><dd><p>
                        Displays upcoming appointments for the next day.
                    </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Demnächst</span></dt><dd><p>
                        Soon means the next five days, excluding today and tomorrow.
                    </p></dd></dl></div><p>
            Like in the other dashboard widgets, the agent can switch between the
filters by clicking on the filter name:
        </p><p>
            </p><div class="figure"><a name="id-1.8.3.13.9.1"></a><p class="title"><b>Abbildung 6.41. Soon filter in upcoming appointments dashboard widget</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="screenshot"><div><img src="screenshots/appointment-calendar/dashboardwidgetsoon.png" alt="Soon filter in upcoming appointments dashboard widget"></div></div></div></div><p><br class="figure-break">
        </p><p>
            Since the appointment information is simplified and needs to be compact in
order to be displayed properly in the small widget, it's possible to show
more detailed information about every value in the related tooltip while
hovering over the column, as visible in the previous screenshot.
        </p><p>
            Basically just the color of the related calendar, the start time of the
appointment and the appointment title will be displayed to the agent. On
hovering over the related column, further information will be displayed if
needed. If the agent clicks on such an appointment, the browser redirects to
the calendar overview screen and opens the related appointment to show the
full set of information.
